In 2002 or so I designed a simple analog LFO for modular synth and desktop bench use. I never documented anything about it, but used it for several years.  
I reverse engineered my own work so here is what I ended up with.  The zip file is the gerber, for PAIA FRAC +15/-15.  
It can pretty easily be redone for SKIFF/Euro and +/- 12V, which I may attempt at some point.
